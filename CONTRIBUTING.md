# Contribution Guidelines

Unfortunately, not every library/tool/framework can be considered. The aim of the list is to provide a concise list of noteworthy modern software. This means that suggested software is either

(a) widely recommended and used regardless of your personal opinion

(b) highly discussed in the community due to its innovative nature

(b) absolutely unique in its approach and function

If a certain entry does not get accepted, you should first look if there has been a discussion before. These discussions are in the issue section and normally marked with the question tag. If there hasn't been such a topic, you are free to create a new issue tagged as question.


Furthermore, please ensure your pull request follows the following guidlines:

* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Please make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Use the following format for libraries: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
* Entries should be sorted in ascending alphabetical order, i.e. a to z.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorisation are welcome.
* Keep descriptions short, simple and unbiased. 
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
